                        <p>
                            COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 and was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It is very contagious and has quickly spread around the world.

                            COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia. COVID-19 may attack more than your lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of your body may also be affected by the disease.

                                <li>Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill.</li>
                                <li>Some people including those with minor or no symptoms may suffer from post-COVID conditions — or “long COVID”.</li>
                                <li>Older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.</li>
                                <li>(Accurate number) of people have died from COVID-19 in Bangladesh.</li>
                                <li>Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective. Vaccines teach our immune system to fight the virus that causes COVID-19.</li>
